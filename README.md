Daily code to track progression throughout my coding journey.
Daily updates now include refactoring for improved time and space efficiency.
I am looking to improve my previous challenges by refactoring them using the least amount of time/space possible.
I will code every day for a year so I can track my progression. I already cringe when i look though code from my first few months.
